Words about this building's structure
=====================================


> View `names.py` for words about renaming files of this sctructure.

Folders with name `'` are folders of data, which is at least one of the following: deprecated, not main, a part of tests, not active programs.

`libs/` — some libraries, which are used here (mainly at `file.py`).
`open_cmd.py` is a tool to open cmd.exe in its folder.
`data/` and `names.py` are storages.

Some constrcuctions are in `data/Structions/`; there go all structed by files `_struct_it.py` and `get_answers.py`.

Main here files-workers: `file.py`, `get_answers.py` and `action.py`. They and the file `_struct_it.py` could be run through the console.


This building's description:
     file.py // It collects the statistics info (by the default — to `data/info.json`, edit — at `names.py`)
        |
        |
        v
  _struct_it.py // It structs the info to the given file with a given percentage
                // (defaultly to the `data/Structions/structed_{PID}.json`)
        |
        |
        v
  get_answers.py // It groups the collected data. The result is suggested to be answers
        |
        |
        v
    action.py // It gives an answer (suggested) to the exect question.
              // Input is a page's code.

The written questions to these files were stored at begginings of those files.

==========================
Other questions and TODOs:

1. libs, names.py, file.py, _struct_it.py, get_answers.py, action.py: Done?
2. action.py: maybeTODO: The thing with "enable stop-word"

I wanted to do a Tkinter version of ``action`` in ``action.py``, but it failed: I hadn't seen the result's output on the PC's screen for a quite long time, however that time it was in the console. The code of that program is in ``_tkaction.py`` (folder `'` in `data/`).
