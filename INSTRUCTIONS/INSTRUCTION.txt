This is an instruction for implementing these writings to get a
http://www.humansnotinvited.com/ pass.

WARNING: This program was written at Windows 10, so it may not work on [some] other.


1. Download it on the PC and install Python there (a version 3.6 or newer), if it isn't.

2. Launch the file `action.py` and copy the whole code of a page (exact at
http://www.humansnotinvited.com/). Possibly it could be done so:
  a) Viewing the page's code — `Ctrl + U` (or with a click of the right button at the page).
  b) Copying all — `Ctrl + A` (for picking the text out) and `Ctrl + C` (to copy the text).

3. Insert the received text into the opened workplace of a file `action.py`,
 print the stop-word (default is "STOP") at a new line [and press `Enter`].
   If all goes by the common scheme, the result will be output on screen within
 a few seconds. P.S. On the computer of this note's writer it lasted for
 approximately 10 seconds.
