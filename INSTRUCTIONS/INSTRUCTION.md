# Instruction

This is an instruction for using these writings to get a <http://www.humansnotinvited.com/> pass.

<!--
<ol> <!- Is it being done correctly? ->
	0. Download it on your PC and install Python there (better a version 3.6 or newer), if it isn't.<br>
	1. Launch the file `action_.py` and copy the whole code of a page (exect at <http://www.humansnotinvited.com/>). Possibly it could be done so:<br>
	+ Viewing the page's code — `Ctrl + U` (or with a click of the right button at the page).<br>
	+ Copying all — `Ctrl + A` (for picking the text out) and `Ctrl + C` (to copy the text).<br>
	2. Insert the received text into the opened console, print "STOP" (or, if the stop-word was changed, print it) and press `Enter`.

1. Download it on your PC and install Python there (a version 3.6 or newer), if it isn't.

2. Launch the file `action.py` and copy the whole code of a page (exect at <http://www.humansnotinvited.com/>). Possibly it could be done with following methods. **Viewing the page's code** — `Ctrl + U` (or with a click of the right button at the page). **Copying all** — `Ctrl + A` (picking the text out) and `Ctrl + C` (to copy the text).

3. Insert the received text into the opened console, print the stop-word (default to "STOP") at a new line and press `Enter`. If all goes by the common scheme, the result will be output on screen within a few seconds (on my computer it lasted approximately 10 seconds).
