Tasks:
* Simplify this folder.
* Make logs to what happens [at some programs]... It might be great for viewing some logs
  after time.  Example: if lauching the function in 2 modes and storing the
  result of each without the mention of mode.
    + Maybe make them and for creating all files and other objects.

`text example.txt` could be used in testings, so should it be at a folder `Examples/`?
